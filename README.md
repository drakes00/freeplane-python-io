# freeplane-python-io

This package provides the user a convenient way to create, read, update and
delete information stored inside Freeplan mindmap files. As an alternative or
an enhancement to working with mindmaps through the original graphical user
interface (GUI) which is provided by the brilliant Freeplane Mindmap Editor,
this package was designed to implement an application programming interface
(API) for Python as well as a command line interface (CLI) both to interact
with Freeplane mindmap files, directly.

## installation

```bash
pip install freeplane-io
```
