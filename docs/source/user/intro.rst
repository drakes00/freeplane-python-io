Introduction
============

*freeplane-python-io* is a Python library for creating and updating Freeplane mindmap
files (.mm).

A typical use would be to automate parsing of mindmap files for any structured
information or todo items, then creating representations (presentations) and
reports in other file formats or for specific platforms like PPTX , Confluence,
JIRA, ... . It might help for any information processing task where the user or
developer does not want to sit in front of the computer screen. But wants
scripting means to takes over and generate high quality information output
especially within recurring processes.

This user guide is tutorial in nature, introducing concepts along with code
examples that we hope will allow any reader to learn what is needed while addressing
the real-life information management challenges based on mindmap sources.
